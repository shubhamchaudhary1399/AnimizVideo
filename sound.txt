U P I apps make payment collection easy. Simple Scan and Pay. Just open any U P I app. Scan the Q R code, fill the amount. And pay successfully without any hassle. But, whenever there is a rush of peoples. Spoof and fraud chances increases. Let's understand how this happens. This is a scenario of a shop. Here multiple peoples are doing payment at the same time. Seller is in trouble because he does not know who paid and who do not. Seller is unable to detect the fraud. How Pay t m tried to stop fraud, when a U P I payment is done. Pay t m sound box alerts with a message. But with rush it fails. Because when multiple payments are done. Sound box plays it alltogether. Shopkeeper is still unable to detect fraud. How we are solving it. When a U P I payment is done an offer is made to the seller via user's app. Payment is confirmed once the seller accepts the offer. Whenever there is a rush. Multiple offers are generated with each user's name and stored inside a queue in sellers app. Seller accepts all the offers one by one. And payment is done accordingly. All the payments are done quickly. All the payments are in real time. No chance of fraud and spoof.
